        "#Data Types and Structures Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "1.\tWhat are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Ans: Data structures are nothing but containers for different kinds of data. Python has four types of Data Structures like lists, sets, tuples and dictionaries.Data Structures are use to store and to process the data in an efficient way which helps easy to access, manipulate the data.   \n",
        "\n",
        "2.\tExplain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples?\n",
        "  Ans:Mutable Objects can change its value without changing memory address, Immutable objects cant be changes after initialized, we can change the value, in the same way memory address will change so that original data will be deleted .\n",
        "Ex: lis=[1,2,3,4]\n",
        "Lis[0]=5 # we can add an item to the list directly\n",
        "Tup=(1,2,3,4)\n",
        "Tup[0]=5 #gives an error, because tuple is imutable type\n",
        "\n",
        "3.\tWhat are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ans:1)\tLists are mutable ------Tuples are immutable\n",
        "  2)\tLists not a hashable type -----Tuples are hashable\n",
        "  3)\tLists need more memory because of manipulations it over allocates memory--- Tuple need less memory\n",
        "  4)\tLists are slow – Tuples process is fast when comparing to lists\n",
        "  5)\tLists are easy to modify --- Modification of a tuple is little tricky\n",
        "  6)\tList are useful to contain the date which changes rapidly like marks, weather temp.---Tuples are useful in handling constant type of data like name, id.\n",
        "  7)\tList has more no.of built-in functions to manipulate access the data ----Tuples having less no.of built-in functions when comparing to a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.\tDescribe how dictionaries store data?\n",
        "-Dictionaries stores the data in the form of Keys and Values where keys are Immutable type. It does not support integer indexing, we should access the data by the keys. Ex: d[‘key_name’]\n",
        "\n",
        "5.\tWhy might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "Set is useful when we need unique/distinct type values.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.\tWhat is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Ans:String is nothing but a data type which holds only sequence of characters. List is a data structure which can contain multiple data type values.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.\tHow do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ans:Tuple are immutable and initialize by using paranthesis () means it holding the values as arguments which are immutable type, this special characteristic that made tuple are powerful data structure in ensuring the data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.\tWhat is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ans: Hash table is a Data structure type that stores the data in the form of keys and values, where keys are generated by hash function. It follows hash mapping which means a piece of code will have a fixed length value. Dictionaries following the same hash type mapping.\n",
        "  Dictionaries are useful in maintaining  cryptographic data such as user_id and password.\n",
        " Ex: dict={“user1”:”pass1”, “user2”:”pass2”,  , , , , ,}\n",
        "\n",
        "9.\tCan lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ans:-Yes, List can contain different data types . Ex: list1=[‘name’, 1,1.2,’True’]\n",
        "\n",
        "10.\tExplain why strings are immutable in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ans:-Immutable means it cant be changed once after created.\n",
        "  Ex:  name_1 = \"Aarun\"\n",
        "              name_1[0] = 'T' #cant be modified by simply assigning with index\n",
        "  Output: TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment\n",
        "  Explanation: We cannot update the string after declaring it means once an immutable the objects instantiated, its value cannot be changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.\tWhat advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ans:-1)Lists takes more time to perform searching tasks like – Dictionaries are quick because of key pairs.\n",
        "  2)Lists can contain duplicate values with different indices- Dictionaries holds unique keys nd duplicate values which means dictionaries implicitly follows uniqueness and duplicates at the same time .\n",
        "  3)List doesn’t support hashable mapping ---- Dictionaries follows hashable mappings\n",
        "  4)list contains mutable data which can rapidly changes---- Dictionaries are immutable type.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.\tDescribe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ans:Tuples are immutable so we can store constant data like name, adhaar no, date of birth\n",
        "  Lists are mutable which is not ideal to store data which doesn’t need changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Tuples are hashable so that we can use a tuple in dictionaries as keys\n",
        "  Lists are not hashable\n",
        "\n",
        "  Tuples are usually contained heterogeneous type\n",
        "  Lists are usually contained homogeneous type data\n",
        "\n",
        "13.\tHow do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Ans:-Set is an unordered collection of data structures which contains unique values only. Even if you enter duplicates while initializing, it automatically deletes the duplicate values while storing/saving.\n",
        "  Ex: a={1,2,3,4,5,6,2,3,1,’a’}\n",
        "  It saves only unique values i.e a={1,2,3,4,5,6,’a’}\n",
        "\n",
        "14.\tHow does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ans:-“In” is a keyword which is used to search the elements.\n",
        "  List can be traversed by the “in” keyword , it checks the values directly.\n",
        "  Whereas in dictionaries the “in’ keyword searches the key elements not values. Here keys can be act s indices of values.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "15.\tCan you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ans:- Tuples are immutable, so once a tuple is created, you can neither change the values of the elements nor add/remove elements without creating a new tuple.\n",
        "  Even if we update using some other ways like by converting into list , the id will change. So we cant modify a tuple.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.\tWhat is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Ans:-Dictionary contains another dictionary as values.\n",
        "  Let’s assume two dictionaries which stores teacher and student records.\n",
        "  Class will have a teacher and students.\n",
        "  Ex: class_dict={“class_name”:”first”, teacher_name:{teachers1.name:”pushpa”,teacher2:”raju”…},student_name:{stu-name:”aarya”,stu_name2:”jovi”…}\n",
        "\n",
        "17.\tDescribe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Ans:- The time complexity of retrieving a value by its key in a dictionary is O(1). This is because dictionaries use a hash table internally which allows constant time lookup.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.\tIn what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Ans:-While we are using mutable type data like marks, dates, time, address, location and etc…\n",
        "  While we’re using homogeneous data which doesn’t need any code pair.\n",
        "  To perform manipulation functions like add, insert, reverse, sort…etc\n",
        "\n",
        "19.\tWhy are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Ans:-Dictionaries are accessed by using keys, we can not perform sorting directly on values. So dictionaries doesn’t follow either ascending or descending order in retrieving values.\n",
        "  So As per keys order only we can access the data. So it is considered as unordered.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.\tExplain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Ans:-Keys referred as indices in dictionaries.\n",
        "  List only supports integer indexing.\n",
        "  2)In dictionaries we can use, Keys() functions and Values() function to retrieve the data\n",
        "  List uses only index\n"
